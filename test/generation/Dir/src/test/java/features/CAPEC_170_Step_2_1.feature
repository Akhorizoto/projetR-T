Feature: CAPEC-170: Web Application Fingerprinting
#2. Experiment
Scenario: Step2.1 Increase the accuracy of server fingerprinting of Web servers
Given prepare to Increase the accuracy of server fingerprinting of Web servers
When Try to Increase the accuracy of server fingerprinting of Web servers
# assertion for attack step success
Then Assert the success of Increase the accuracy of server fingerprinting of Web servers
#assertions for security pattern testing (checker whether the pattern consequences are observed)
Then assert the consequences of the pattern 
           #
